For example, a survey may ask car drivers their age and make/model of car. A marketing team may want to know the average age of drivers of Ford Mustangs so they can target their audience. Calculating a mean is easy, but what about the uncertainty in that mean? You could compute the population standard deviation, but that pre-supposes the underlying distribution is Gaussian. Another method, that does not make any assumptions about the distribution is *bootstrapping*. Randomly remove values from the data and replace them with copies of other values. Compute a new mean. Do that N times and compute the standard deviation of these *bootstrapped* mean values.\n",

If you are running your code on an HPC cluster, it needs to be run from the command-line. Lastly, writing code that runs with minimal user-interaction makes it more repeatable.\n",

    "- convert columns in the file into `numpy` arrays,\n",
