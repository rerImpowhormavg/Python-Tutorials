The point is to illustrate how you can get existing modules to do the heavy-lifting for you and that visualization is a powerful diagnostic tool. Try not to get caught up in the details of the model (read the citation if you're really interested).\n",

    "This notebook requires the following modules:\n",
    "* `numpy`: dealing with arrays of numbers and mathematics\n",
    "* `scipy`: collection of scientific algorithms\n",
    "* `matplotlib`: de-facto plotting module\n",
    "* `pandas`: module for organizing arrays of number into tables\n",

    "In this case, the data to model is roughly 10 years of photometry from the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP). Each and every measurement of the flux from a standard star has an associated estimate of the sky background (which must be subtracted from the raw counts of the star). This data is located in a MySQL database. MySQL has its own internal language for querying data, joining tables together, filtering, etc. We won't cover that here, but simply give you the SQL query needed to extract the data we need:  coordinates (RA,DEC) on the sky, date of observation, and observed sky brightness. Let's start by getting the data. We'll use `pandas` and its build-in SQL engine. First, we need to create a connection engine to the MySQL database using its `URL`:"

    "### 2)  The Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Turns out that the definitive reference for this was authored by a colleague of mine:  Kevin Krisciunas at Texas A&M. His paper can be found at the ADS abstract service:  http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1991PASP..103.1033K\n",

    "\n",
    "1) The lunar phase angle: $\\alpha$\n",
    "2) The angular separation between the sky field and the moon: $\\rho$\n",
    "3) The Zenith angle of the sky field:  $Z$\n",
    "4) The Zenith angle of the moon:  $Z_m$\n",
    "5) The extinction coefficient:  $k_X$\n",
    "6) The dark-sky (no moon) sky background at zenith (in mag/square-arc-sec):  $m_{dark}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, $\\alpha$, $\\rho$, $Z$, and $Z_m$ are all functions of the date of observations and sky coordinates, which we have already. That leaves $k_x$ and $m_{dark}$ to be determined. Given these variables, the flux from the moon is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I^* = 10^{-0.4(3.84 + 0.026|\\alpha | + 4\\times 10^{-9}\\alpha^4)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This flux is then scattered by angle $\\rho$ into our line of sight, contributing to the sky background. The fraction of light scattered into angle $\\rho$ is given empirically by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(\\rho) = 10^{5.36}\\left[1.06 + \\cos^2\\rho\\right] + 10^{6.15 - \\rho/40} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This scattered light is then attenuated by the atmosphere. This attenuation is parametrized by the *airmass* $X$, the relative amount of atmosphere the light has to penetrate (with $X=1$ for the zenith). Krisciunas & Schaefer (1991) present this formula for the airmass:  $X(Z) = \\left(1 - 0.96 \\sin^2 Z\\right)^{-1/2}$. We'll come back to this later. Suffice it to say for the moment that this is an approximation very close to the \"infinite slab\" model of the atmosphere. Putting it all together, the surface brigthness (in nanoLamberts) from the moon will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ B_{moon} = f(\\rho)I^*10^{-0.4 k_X X(Z_m)}\\left[1 - 10^{-0.4k_X X(Z)}\\right] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, to convert these nanoLamberts into magnitudes per square arc-second, we need the dark (no moon) sky brightness at the zenith, $m_{dark}$, and convert that to nanoLamberts using this formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ B_{dark} = 34.08\\exp (20.7233 - 0.92104 m_{dark})10^{-0.4 k_X (X(Z)-1)}X(Z) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we have also corrected for attenuation by the atmosphere and air-glow (which increases with airmass). The final model for observed sky brightness $m_{sky}$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ m_{sky} = m_{dark} - 2.5 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{B_{moon} + B_{dark}}{B_{dark}}\\right) $$\n",

    "Now, we just need the final ingredients:  $\\alpha$, $\\rho$, $Z$, and $Z_m$, all of which are computed using `ephem`. The lunar phase angle $\\alpha$ is defined as the angular separation between the moon and sun as observed on the moon. Alas, ephem can't compute this directly (guess they never thought lunar astronauts would use the software). But since the Earth-moon distance is much less than the Earth-sun distance, this is close enough 180 degrees minus the angular separation between the moon and sun as observed on Earth (which `ephem` can compute). As before, we use a `for` loop to compute the needed quantities."

    "At this point you might be feeling overwhelmed. How did I know which modules to use? How did I know how to use them? The answer:  Google, ADS, and 20+ years (eek!) of experience coding in Python. I also neglected to show all the dead-ends and mistakes I made on the way to getting the final solution, all the emails I sent to Kevin asking about the details of his paper, and advice I got from Shannon about using Bokeh.\n",

    "Before you start tackling a particular problem it's well worth your time to research whether there is already a solution \"out there\" that you can use or modify for your use. It has never been so easy to do this, thanks to search engines (Google, et al.), data/software catalogs (PyPI, et al.), discussion groups (stackoverflow, et al.) and even social media (python facebook group, etc). And your friendly neighborhood python experts are there to make helpful suggestions.\n",
